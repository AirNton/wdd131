            <h2>Alma 32: 21</h2>
            <p>21 And now as I said concerning faithâ€”faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.</p>

            <h2>Moroni 10: 3-4</h2>
            <p>3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.<p>

            <p>4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
