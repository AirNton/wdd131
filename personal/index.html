        <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
        <p class="meet">Our Purpose is to bring a accurate scale of how good each individual bathroom is to BYUI. We want to help every student know where the best place to do their businiss is and where they should avoid</p>
        <h2>Our Grading Scale</h2>
        <p>Our Grading scale is quite strict, and while we can't quanitfy what each value is here are some of the things we look for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uneven or even urinals avalible</li>
                <li>Sink to stall ratio</li>
                <li>Area used (is there a lot of open space or is it cramped)</li>
                <li>Mirror locations(some of them have wierd placemnts)</li>
                <li>Bathroom locations(is it easy to find)</li>
                <li>Overalll cleanliness</li>
                <li>Random person ratings(they have the final say no matter what)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p class="meet">Our team is made up of four elite members. We have --REDACTED-- who is super strong. Easly the strongest of our group. With a 325 bench he knows what he's doing in the gym. This obviosly translate over to rating bathrooms. When he speeks we listen. Next we have --Error--. With long hair and glasses, you think that he would be super smart. But he really isn't. --Error-- is on an acedemic comeback though so watch out! Up next is --Classified-- he's pretty fun to be around. That's about it. Finally we have Andrew! The best looking and the brains of the group. He is the one making this website by the way. Names have been removed becuase I didn't feel like asking if they were okay with their names being included.</p>
